I'm a game developer and software technologist with additional background in theatre, film studies, Japanese, and English writing.

A dual interest in game development and performance arts may seem contrary, but I often think about the state of "play" across disciplines, and how performers (especially in *plays*) are similar to players of video games. I also think that media literacy is an underrated quality nowadays, and that the a good game developer has a breadth of experiences and areas of interest. Video games primarily interest me for their storytelling potential. My favorite video games have strong narratives and cinematic qualities.

Although I have an arts degree, I also have the fortune/misfortune of possessing that engineer's trait of wanting to know how things work, and am compelled to take things apart and put them back together in that pursuit. So I enjoy being close to a game's design and the development of its mechanics, and I take pleasure in the problem solving along the way--but I also enjoy new plots, characters, and cinematography.

After my college days studying software, I have very low intimidation when learning how to use new technologies. I did so many things in that program I never thought I would be able to do, on many platforms in many languages: from network security, to website design, to embedded systems programming, and more. When I returned to study game design, I was able to capitalize on my prior experience and complete projects that reflect my ability as a game developer.

I'm excited to start another chapter in my journey and feel more confident than ever that I have the skillset to succeed at whatever I do next.
