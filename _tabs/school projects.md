Big Ugly Alien Eye Monsters
===========================

![BUAEMS](assets/images/buaems-1.png "BUAEMS")

{: style="text-align: justify" }
I made this game by myself over the course of two weeks amidst life's other obligations. It was for our Game Engine Lab II class at school, and we were allowed to do whatever we wanted with the theme of "projectile dodging chaos."

{: style="text-align: justify" }
I wanted to include moments where random skill upgrades were offered to the player and for them to have gradations of effect when selected multiple times, like many roguelike games. I also I knew I wanted to create an intro sequence with some expository content. I am generally pleased with the result, although I did not get as far as creating a boss or a real endgame besides dying.

Lava Rider
===========================

{: style="text-align: justify" }
This was a group project for one of my game design courses. We were given "sine waves" as one of the themes we could pursue. I was interested in a surfing context but wanted a different aesthetic and was inspired by the image in my head of a skeleton doing tricks on waves of lava.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
The team wanted to mimick the collection of S-K-A-T-E letters in Tony Hawk games and a trick system that rewarded you for doing spins in the air (Arrow Keys) after jumping (Space) while holding down a trick button (Q, W, E). We had some success here and even implemented alternate tricks if you hold down Shift.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
I did a lot of the programming and some of the visual effects. This could be improved--the invisible walls at the edges of the levels aren't very engaging and a camera that adjusts its depth to allow the player to see more of the environment when necessary would be ideal.

Rhythm Schism
===========================

{: style="text-align: justify" }
This is a group project based an idea for an FPS that I proposed where you had to shoot on rhythm with music in order to deal damage. The environment is a randomly-generated 5x5 grid of rooms with different entrances and exits, and it has three levels with three color palettes for the destructible blocks. I made the gun model, roll enemy and stationary enemy, logic to match a certain BPM, and random room generation script.

Voxel Crash
===========================

![Voxel Crash](assets/images/crash-1.png "Voxel Crash")

{: style="text-align: justify" }
Every week in the 'Game Studio' college course I took, students were given a simple word prompt. Each student was expected to solo-dev a game prototype using the suggestion in 7 days. This was the third week of that course and the prompt was "Chain Reactions."

{: style="text-align: justify" }
I made this, a demo of a Burnout-inspired game using the voxel aesthetic. Actually deforming car models with physics is a gargantuan task: making cars explode into voxel cubes is was a much more game jam-friendly objective. I made the voxel car models and music.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
In part, I used it as an opportunity to implement a debug screen for a game with properties that you can change and observe their effect in real-time. It is accessible from the pause menu (Escape key) and lets you do things like reset the car's position, which you will probably have to do in order to continue crashing around You're able to escape the bounds quite easily in this build.

It Snowballed From There
===========================

![It Snowballed From There](assets/images/snow-1.png "It Snowballed From There")

{: style="text-align: justify" }
This is not much of a "game" as-is, but it is another weekly jam project from school that looks kind of neat and accomplishes a gameplay mechanic that I had in mind. I wanted to mimic Katamari Damacy's ball-rolling and picking-up-stuff mechanic, and implemented a color palette and pixel filter that gives it a little more panache than it had otherwise.
