This is a group project based an idea for an FPS that I proposed where you had to shoot on rhythm with music in order to deal damage. The environment is a randomly-generated 5x5 grid of rooms with different entrances and exits, and it has three levels with three color palettes for the destructible blocks. I made the gun model, roll enemy and stationary enemy, logic to match a certain BPM, and random room generation script.
