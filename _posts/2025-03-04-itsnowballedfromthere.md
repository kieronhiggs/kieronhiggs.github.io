This is not much of a "game" as-is, but it is another weekly jam project from school that looks kind of neat and accomplishes a gameplay mechanic that I had in mind. I wanted to mimic Katamari Damacy's ball-rolling and picking-up-stuff mechanic, and implemented a color palette and pixel filter that gives it a little more panache than it had otherwise.
