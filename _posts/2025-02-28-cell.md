{: style="text-align: justify" }
This game was developed over the course of five days for a game jam at school. I joined the group on Day 2, and embraced a sort of exercise where I didn't try to change anything about the design that was discussed on Day 1, but rather said, "What do you need me to do?" and did my best to help the team realize what they had in mind originally.

{: style="text-align: justify" }
The team wanted an item inspection system akin to other survival horror games in which items can be picked up and rotated to be looked at from every angle, so I put that together. To reach these moments, I wanted to implement an easy-to-use interaction system with contextual button prompts and smooth movements when the camera transitions between player and "interaction stations" like the alchemy table.

I modeled the alchemy table (not its beakers) with the hidden compartment, the puzzle piece solution table with its two drawers, and the safe with its numpad. I animated the drawers, doors, and safe. I programmed the puzzle solution table, calendar, and safe. I recorded some voice lines for the player that I think fit into the horror pastiche we were going for.
