I made this game by myself over the course of two weeks amidst life's other obligations. It was for our Game Engine Lab II class at school, and we were allowed to do whatever we wanted with the theme of "projectile dodging chaos."

I wanted to include moments where random skill upgrades were offered to the player and for them to have gradations of effect when selected multiple times, like many roguelike games. I also I knew I wanted to create an intro sequence with some expository content. I am generally pleased with the result, although I did not get as far as creating a boss or a real endgame besides dying.
