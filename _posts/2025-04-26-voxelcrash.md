Every week in the 'Game Studio' college course I took, students were given a simple word prompt. Each student was expected to solo-dev a game prototype using the suggestion in 7 days. This was the third week of that course and the prompt was "Chain Reactions."

I made this, a demo of a Burnout-inspired game using the voxel aesthetic. Actually deforming car models with physics is a gargantuan task: making cars explode into voxel cubes is was a much more game jam-friendly objective. I made the voxel car models and music.

In part, I used it as an opportunity to implement a debug screen for a game with properties that you can change and observe their effect in real-time. It is accessible from the pause menu (Escape key) and lets you do things like reset the car's position, which you will probably have to do in order to continue crashing around You're able to escape the bounds quite easily in this build.
