This was a group project for one of my game design courses. We were given "sine waves" as one of the themes we could pursue. I was interested in a surfing context but wanted a different aesthetic and was inspired by the image in my head of a skeleton doing tricks on waves of lava.

The team wanted to mimick the collection of S-K-A-T-E letters in Tony Hawk games and a trick system that rewarded you for doing spins in the air (Arrow Keys) after jumping (Space) while holding down a trick button (Q, W, E). We had some success here and even implemented alternate tricks if you hold down Shift.

I did a lot of the programming and some of the visual effects. This could be improved--the invisible walls at the edges of the levels aren't very engaging and a camera that adjusts its depth to allow the player to see more of the environment when necessary would be ideal.
